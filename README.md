# Spiral Crops for Agri-Robots
This repository contains a collection of simulations, navigation pipelines optimesed for Spiral Field loyout that facilitates efficient robot navigation.

We also provide an [open-source square-spirals toolkit](https://github.com/rajithadesilva/square_spirals) that supports defining and visualising square spirals, performing 2D-to-1D coordinate transformations, calculating lengths, and characterising individual segments.
