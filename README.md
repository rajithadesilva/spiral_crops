# Spiral Crops for Agri-Robots
This repository contains a collection of simulations, navigation pipelines optimesed for Spiral Field loyout that facilitates efficient robot navigation.

**We are in the process of finalising this repository. For now please refer below links to access individual sub-components of our pipeline.**
- [Crop Row Detection](https://github.com/lakshanlavan/Crop_WPNet)
- [Line following](https://github.com/lakshanlavan/husky-eyeview-lane-follow)
- [Gazebo Simulation](https://github.com/lakshanlavan/Field_LFNV)

We also provide an [open-source square-spirals toolkit](https://github.com/rajithadesilva/square_spirals) that supports defining and visualising square spirals, performing 2D-to-1D coordinate transformations, calculating lengths, and characterising individual segments.
